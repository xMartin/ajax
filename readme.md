# How does Ajax work?

A bunch of running code examples demonstrating a simple Ajax call and displaying of the result.

Just make this directory available on a web server and open any of the HTML files.

Example how to run a server if you have Python installed (on Mac OS or many Linux systems it is):

    cd ajax
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
